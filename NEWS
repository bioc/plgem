version 1.15.11
===============

o minor changes:
--added warnings in function `plgem.fit', displayed if the fitting parameters
  are outside the normally observed range of values;
--removed `library' calls from source code (NAMESPACE should take care of
  package dependencies).

===============
version 1.15.10
===============

o minor changes:
--added `NEWS' file.

==============
version 1.15.9
==============

o major changes:
--Modified output of function `plgem.obsStn' to contain also the output of
  function `plgem.fit';
--Modified output of functions `plgem.deg' and `run.plgem' to contain also the
  output of functions `plgem.obsStn' and `plgem.pValue'; significant features
  are now listed by their names only (no more associated observed STN value) as
  a separate element of the output list, called `significant';
--Modified functions `plgem.deg' and `plgem.pValue' to deal with the new output
  of function `plgem.obsStn';
--Modified function `plgem.write.summary' to deal with the new output of
  functions `plgem.deg' and `run.plgem'.

o minor changes:
--due to more complex outputs of functions `plgem.obsStn' and
  `plgem.resampledStn', splitted the documentation into two independent man
  file;
--enhanced status message printed out by function `run.plgem' about the
  condition being selected for fitting the model;
--added argument `prefix' to function `plgem.write.summary' to allow user to
  specify a prefix to prepend to the file names;
--modified documentation to reflect all above changes.


==============
version 1.15.8
==============

o minor changes:
--added clear statements throughout the vignette and other package documentation
  that two replicates are required and sufficient to fit a PLGEM (although, of
  course, having more replicates can only improve the fitting);
--changed URL in reference to MCP paper to point to the abstract, rather than
  the to full text (which not everyone might have access to);
--further improved rendering of math equations in documentation;
--added a check for consistency of input baseline condition in functions
  `plgem.obsStn', `plgem.resampledStn' and `run.plgem';
--improved error messages from private check functions. 


==============
version 1.15.7
==============

o minor changes:
--fixed a documentation bug that was causing a CHECK error in the manual page of
  function `run.plgem';
--added a private function to perform a consistency check for the input
  ExpressionSet;
--improved display of math expressions in PDF versions of manual pages.


==============
version 1.15.6
==============

o major changes:
--replaced argument `covariateNumb' with `covariate' and allowed to specify the
  covariate also by its name (rather than only by its number);
--replaced argument `fit.condition' and `baseline.condition' with `fitCondition'
  and `baselineCondition', respectively, and allowed to specify the condition
  also by its name (rather than only by its number);
--added arguments `trimAllZeroRows' and `zeroMeanOrSD' also to function
  `run.plgem' to improve fitting in cases with many zero values;

o minor changes:
--updated package documentation to reflect above changes;
--added `COVARIATE' to the value of function `plgem.fit';
--added file `privateFunctions.R' to have small auxiliary functions all in one
  place, improving modularity and readability of source code;
--fixed a bug when more than one condition had the highest number of replicates
  (argument `covariate' was not passed to function `plgem.fit');
--overall code optimization.


==============
version 1.15.5
==============

o major changes:
--added arguments `trimAllZeroRows' and `zeroMeanOrSD' to function `plgem.fit'
  to improve fitting in cases with many zero values;

o minor changes:
--minor amendments to the vignette.


==============
version 1.15.4
==============

o minor changes:
--overall reformatting of vignette for improved readability.


==============
version 1.15.3
==============

o major changes:
--fixed dependencies in NAMESPACE that were causing check errors when trying to
  load the namespace.


==============
version 1.15.2
==============

o minor changes:
--replaced `.First.lib' with `.onLoad' in zzz.r file (due to adding a NAMESPACE
  to the package);
--updated e-mail address in man files.


==============
version 1.15.1
==============

o major changes:
--added NAMESPACE.

o minor changes:
--updated references in vignette and man pages.


==============
version 1.11.3
==============

o minor changes:
--added a few argument checks to generate meaningful error messages in case
  argument `covariateNumb' was not a number, or arguments `q' or `signLev' were
  outside the allowed range (i.e. between 0 and 1).


==============
version 1.11.2
==============

o minor changes:
--fixed documentation bug (missing link to `ExpressionSet' class);
--overall improvement of help files and vignettes.


==============
version 1.11.1
==============

o major changes:
--added function `plgem.pValue' to calculate p-values for given observed STN
  values.


==============
version 1.11.0
==============

o major changes:
--corrected the object class for LPSeset, which is now an `ExpressionSet' rather
  than an `exprSet'.


==============
version 1.9.1
==============

o major changes:
--`LPSeset' dataset has been updated from `exprSet' to `ExpressionSet' class;
--the requirement of the `conditionName' covariate in the `phenoData' of the
  `ExpressionSet' has been eliminated; now a numeric index (`covariateNumb')
  needs to be provided to indicate which covariate has to be used to identify
  the different experimental conditions and set of replicated arrays on the
  `ExpressionSet';
--updated functions to deal with the switch from the `exprSet' to the
  `ExpressionSet' class and on the addition of the `covariateNumb' argument;
--added new function `plgem.write.summary',  providing a simple wrapper for
  writing on the disk the list(s) of differentially expressed genes.

o minor changes:
--updated package documentation to reflect all above changes;
